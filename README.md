# Build and train a classifier

## Introduction
Build and train a classifier given a labeled dataset and then use it to infer the labels of a given unlabeled evaluation dataset

You must build and train a classifier given a labeled dataset and then use it to infer the labels of a given unlabeled evaluation dataset. You must then submit the inferred labels in a specified format, which will be compared to our evaluation data that has the correct labels (not shared, held out). If you want an unbiased estimate of how your model is performing, you can do your own train/test split using the supplied training data. After the competition/exam we will also publish the held-out true labels enabling you to compute your exact score.

The accuracy achieved by your model on our (held out) evaluation data maps to the score that it will receive in the challenge according to the curve below:
